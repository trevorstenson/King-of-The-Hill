# King-of-The-Hill

A simple Ethereum based betting game where players compete to have the highest value wager in the pot. 
Every time a bet is placed, the time until the competition ends increases by 60 minutes. 
When time runs out, the highest bidder wins 90% of the total pot, the owner receives 5%, and a new game is started with the remaining 5%.
